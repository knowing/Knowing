The **Knowing** framework is designed for modular, data mining applications which run in an OSGi Environment. Furthermore Knowing should help to scale data mining task into a cloud system. Project main goals are:

* Wrappper data mining API for existing libraries (e.g. WEKA)
* Data mining-process structure
* Distributed / Parallel execution
